	Apply the technique for fixing Listing 4.14 to Listing 4.15 in the book, but to the following:
	- Create a thread-safe Counter class that stores an int and supports increment and decrement.
	- Create a new thread-safe class Point, which stores two Counter objects.
	- The two counter objects should be public.
	- Implement the method boolean areEqual() in Point, which returns true if the two counters store the same value.
	
	Question: Is the code you obtained robust with respect to client-side locking (see book)?
	          Would it help if the counters were private?
