	Modify the threads/cp/SynchronizedMap2T example such that:
	- There are now two maps (instead of just one) for accumulating results, one for each thread.
	- Each thread uses only its own map, without synchronizing on it.
	- After the threads terminate, create a new map where you merge the results of the two dedicated maps.
	
	Questions:
	- Does the resulting code work? Can you explain why?
	- Does the resulting code perform better or worse than the original example SynchronizedMap2T?
	- Can you hypothesise why?
